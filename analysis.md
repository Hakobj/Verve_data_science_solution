Problems:
1. Class imbalance problem, which can introduce bias during prediction (F1-score should be chosen as a metric),
2. Click column is not so informative, because "Yes" contains small number of rows, so probably it will have approximately zero impact on classification,
3. As 59% of "Device name" column values are missing, this feature impact can be low. In particular, in inference time when new "Device name" is coming, which is very probable, this feature will be useless. But this problem is general for categorical data, when new value is coming during inference (it can be the case also in app_category and ad_category).
4. App categories containg "News" and "Wheather" are about 80% of all app_categories. These 2 categories are general, not gender specific, so it seems that they will have a little impact for gender prediction (this is hyphothesis, which should be checked),
5. Seems user_id is redundant feature, it should be removed. After train-test split, some user_ids can be repaeted in train and test set, model can memorize user_ids in train set and do prediction in test set mainly based on user_id. But in real data (during inference) new user is coming with new id, so the model cannot use this information. So, we will have high score on train and test data, and low score on inference data.

Features:
1. app_category - this one is definetily important feature, because it shows the area of app. This can be useful for gender prediction, because some categories
will be chosen by females in most times (like "Desert and baking", "Fashion") and some other categories will be chosen by males (like automotove),
2. ad_category - this one is important as previous one, because it shows the are of ad. "Jewerly", "Beauty", "Clothing" most probably will contain female category and "Beer and wine", "Telecommunications" will be chosen by males.
3. I will add features, which are counts per app_category and counts per ad_category,
4. I will add new features from external sources about statistics for different app_categories and add_categories per gender,
5. Also, "interaction_with_app" can be useful. The hyphothesis is that females are using apps more time than males. But this should be checked during EDA.

Modeling:
To have a prototype, I will choose Logistig Regression as a first algorithm. Advantages of this choice is simplicity of model, which will let us to have reliable and interpretable results. Also, as we have simple algorithm, feeding data into it will be quick, algorithm will run quickly and we can try different hyperparamaters in short of time. Model simplicity is also distavtange of Logistic Regression, becuase complex patterns cannot be found via this algorithm and we cannot achieve high score.
